Through the use of a news sentiment index in conjunction with conventional economic indicators, this project seeks to improve the predictability of the US recession. The sentiment index is calculated using news data that is gathered on subjects such as stocks, the economy, and Federal Open Market Committee minutes. The models use the NBER data as a benchmark for validation in order to forecast both recessionary and non-recessionary periods in the US.
